Generative Label for Mobile Homes

What is Mobile Homes

I have a need for a packaging redesign for a product I make called Mobile Homes (http://blightdesign.com/misc_mobile.html).  Mobiles made up of small  wooden houses.

There is an order for 40 units and I would like to repackage the mobiles and give each one a unique label.  My goal is to make the label a desirable object that one would like to hang on the wall.  Each label would be a print in essence, and would have the print number on it (number 3 of 40 for example).

Due to constraints, the mobile must be packaged in a 10.5" x 3.5" x 1.25" cardboard box.

I plan on showing off the mobile image in a generative format.  The mobiles will come in two colors, red and natural poplar, I would like to create labels with two distant color pallets, red and blonde.  

The label must have the product name on it, fit the selected packaging, must have my information (name, logo, website url), print number ("print x of 40"), and possible more misc. info.

I want the label to be a folded sleeve that will slide over the box.

I would like to give the overall design a hand drawn look, similar to http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/randomization/toxiclibs_splines_5.jpg.

Font choice(s) will need to be addressed.  A grid system based on the sleeve folds will need to be developed.  And paper selection and folding methods will need to be researched.
